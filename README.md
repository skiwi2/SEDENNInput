## Running the program

First to get the GloVe dataset you need to download http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip and extract it to D:\Downloads. Secondly you need to make sure that you use `-Djava.library.path=""` in your JVM options when running this program.

It also may take a minute before a result is given due to loading the big dataset.
